This is a small article about "understanding the Ruby object model". See output:

 *[.pdf]() 
 *[.html]() 



The actual document is `ruby-object-model.md` which is auto generated from src/* with `npm run concat`.

To generate PDF and HTML versions:

```sh
npm i # only needed once
npm run all
````

That should generate `docs/ruby-object-model.html` and `docs/ruby-object-model.pdf`
